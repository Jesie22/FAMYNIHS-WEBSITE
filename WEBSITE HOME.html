                    <h4>FNIHS HISTORY</h4>
                    <p>Famy National Integrated High School, originally a small farm, transformed into a place of knowledge and wisdom. Under President Ferdinand Marcos' regime, Presidential Decree no. 479, s. 1974, was signed into law in 1962. In 1969, the principal of Famy Elementary School, Mr. Nemecio Abary, and other educators, along with district supervisors and parents, opened a new school with a small population of 64 students. The school was later named Famy Community High School, and a Marcos Type Building was built for knowledge enhancement and skills development. The school's first recognition was as champion in the Citizen Army Training Competition. Mrs. Elfleda Real became principal in 1978, and Mrs. Ligaya Manaig served as Officer-in-Charge in 1983. From 1985 to 2013, Mrs. Lourdes served as the school's mother, raising the standards of education. The school was renamed Famy National High School in 1994, but was unable to celebrate its Silver Founding Anniversary due to Typhoon Katrina.</p>
